# Data Balancing with GenAI - Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Summary: 
- This project focuses on addressing data imbalance in the context of credit card fraud detection using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Imbalanced datasets, such as those encountered in fraud detection, often lead to biased model performance.
- To overcome this challenge, this project uses GAN to generate synthetic data, thereby balancing the dataset. GANs create artificial samples that resemble the minority class, improving the model's ability to recognize and classify fraud instances accurately.

## Background:
This dataset is provided by Secure Trust Financial Services. And the model is a binary classifier but it is not working well because the data is imbalanced. To solve this problem, General Adversial Networks (GANs), a type of generative AI is used, to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions that are indistinguishable from real transactions. This method will help to improve the accuracy of the fraud detection model.

## Process:
